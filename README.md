Made a dashboard in PowerBi by which we can get some insights from it like:
1) Most game title sold worldwide = "Grand Theft Auto V".
2) Which year has the highest sales = "2008" (After that we can see major declination in the sales).
3) Which console has the highest sales = "PS2 & PC" games has the highest grossing game titles.
